## Current Focus: Server-Side Email Migration Automation

We've successfully implemented server-side automation for the email migration process. This system allows the migration to continue running in the background, even when the browser window is closed.

### Key Components Implemented

1. **Server-Side Processing**
   - Created a new Edge Function (`server-automation`) to handle continuous processing
   - Implemented heartbeat mechanism to track automation status
   - Added smart batch processing with rate limit handling

2. **Database Updates**
   - Extended the email_migration_automation table with heartbeat and status fields
   - Added tracking for current batch processing

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Added real-time heartbeat monitoring with visual indicators
   - Implemented status display showing current processing state
   - Created progress tracking for active batches

4. **Reliability Features**
   - Automatic stalled record detection and recovery
   - Exponential backoff for API rate limit handling
   - Scheduled cron job to ensure automation runs consistently

### Next Steps

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Analyze and optimize batch processing for higher throughput
   - Implement adaptive batch sizing based on API response times

2. **Reporting Enhancements**
   - Add detailed statistics on migration speed and efficiency
   - Create visual charts for migration progress over time

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Add estimated completion time calculations
   - Enhance notification system for important events

### Recent Changes
- Added heartbeat monitoring to the automation system
- Implemented server-side batch processing independent of browser state
- Created UI components to display automation status and health
- Set up reliability mechanisms to ensure consistent processing
