# Email Migration: Active Context

## Current Status
We are in the **Implementation Phase** with **Server-Side Automation**. The migration is approximately **60.5% complete** with around 2,690 subscribers migrated out of 4,449 total.

## Current Solution
1. **Server-Side Automation**:
   - Implemented continuous server-side processing that runs independently of browser sessions
   - Added heartbeat monitoring to verify automation is running
   - Created scheduled background processing via cron job
   - Added dynamic batch sizing based on success rates

2. **Stalled Record Recovery**:
   - Implemented logic to detect and reset records stuck in "in_progress" state for more than 30 minutes
   - Created automatic cleanup mechanism to prevent accumulation of stalled records

3. **Enhanced Rate Limit Handling**:
   - Implemented intelligent back off for rate limited requests
   - Added proper logging of API responses and errors

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Monitor Server-Side Automation**:
   - Track heartbeat status to ensure continuous processing
   - Verify stalled record recovery is working properly
   - Monitor success rates and adjust batch sizes if needed

2. **Finalize Migration**:
   - Verify all subscribers are processed correctly
   - Conduct final checks and balances
   - Generate comprehensive migration report

## Current Focus
The primary focus is ensuring the server-side automation runs reliably until all subscribers are migrated. We'll continue to monitor the heartbeat and check for any stalled records or rate limiting issues.
