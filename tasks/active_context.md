# Email Migration: Active Context

## Current Status
We are in the **Implementation Phase** with **Automation Issues**. The migration is approximately **60.5% complete** with around 2,690 subscribers migrated out of 4,449 total.

## Current Issues
1. **Automation Stopping**: The migration automation stops after processing a few batches, likely because it's client-side and terminates when the page refreshes or closes.
2. **Rate Limiting**: Potential BeehiiV API rate limits causing interruptions.
3. **Stalled Records**: Possible records stuck in "in_progress" state preventing new batch processing.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Move Automation to Server-Side**:
   - Implement a continuous server-side process that runs independently of browser sessions
   - Add configuration to control automation without requiring browser presence
   - Create heartbeat monitoring to verify automation is running

2. **Implement Stalled Record Recovery**:
   - Add logic to detect and reset records stuck in "in_progress" state for more than 30 minutes
   - Create automatic cleanup mechanism to prevent accumulation of stalled records

3. **Enhance Rate Limit Handling**:
   - Implement exponential backoff for rate limited requests
   - Add dynamic batch sizing based on successful API calls
   - Create proper Retry-After header handling

## Current Focus
The primary focus is fixing the automation to make it run continuously without requiring the admin page to stay open. We need to move the batch processing logic entirely to the server side via Edge Functions while maintaining the ability to monitor and control the process through the admin UI.
