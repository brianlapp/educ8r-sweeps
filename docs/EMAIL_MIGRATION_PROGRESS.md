## Technical Insights

### Automation Features
- **Stalled Record Detection**: Automatically detects and resets records stuck in "in_progress" state
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Implements exponential backoff for rate limited requests
- **Operating Hours**: Configurable hours for when migration should run
- **Batch Sizing**: Dynamic batch sizing based on configuration

### Repository Import System
The system includes a repository-based import feature that:
1. Scans the `/public/emails/` directory for CSV files
2. Allows admins to select files for import via the UI
3. Processes and imports the selected files
4. Automatically moves processed files to `/public/emails/completed/`

### Debugging & Diagnostics
The system now includes enhanced diagnostic features:
1. Diagnostic logging panel for troubleshooting
2. Path checking utilities to verify file system access
3. Multiple fallback mechanisms for file listing
4. Detailed error reporting for import attempts

## Next Steps
1. **Archive migration infrastructure**:
   - Consider disabling the server-side automation now that migration is complete
   - Archive migration tables in database for historical reference

2. **Final verification**:
   - Verify all subscribers have been properly tagged in BeehiiV
   - Ensure welcome emails were not duplicated

## Critical API Requirements
- ‚úÖ **BeehiiV API custom fields in array format**: `[{"name": "first_name", "value": "John"}]`
- ‚ùå **Not as object format**: `{"first_name": "John"}` (causes HTTP 400 errors)

## Verification Checklist
- [x] All subscribers migrated
- [x] No duplicate welcome emails sent
- [x] All subscribers properly tagged in BeehiiV
- [ ] Migration table archived
- [ ] Migration functions disabled
