## Status: Implementation Phase - Debugging & Automation Issues

## Current Issues
- ✅ Fixed: Incorrect custom fields format causing HTTP 400 errors
- ⚠️ Automation stopping after processing a few batches
- ⚠️ Potential rate limiting causing interruptions in processing
- ⚠️ Possible stalled records in "in_progress" state preventing new batch processing

## Recent Fixes
- Added enhanced SQL monitoring functions for detailed analytics
- Fixed BeehiiV API integration by using correct custom fields format
- Added comprehensive documentation to prevent regression
- Enhanced error logging for better troubleshooting

## Next Steps
1. **Implement stalled record detection and reset**:
   - Automatically detect and reset records stuck in "in_progress" state
   - Add timestamp tracking for "in_progress" records to detect stalled operations
   - Create admin control to manually reset stuck batches

2. **Enhance rate limit handling**:
   - Implement exponential backoff for rate limited requests
   - Add dynamic batch sizing based on API response patterns
   - Record successful batch sizes for optimization

3. **Improve automation reliability**:
   - Add heartbeat monitoring for automation process
   - Implement checkpoint system to resume from last successful batch
   - Create detailed logging of automation lifecycle events

4. **Add comprehensive analytics**:
   - Success/failure rates by batch
   - Processing speed metrics
   - Time-of-day performance analysis

## Technical Insights

### Automation Stopping Issues
The automation appears to process a few batches successfully but then stops. Potential causes:

1. **Rate Limiting Detection**: The system may encounter rate limiting but fail to properly resume after the cooldown period.

2. **Error Handling Gaps**: Certain errors may not be properly caught and handled, causing the automation process to terminate.

3. **Process Monitoring Issues**: The automation may not be properly tracking its own operational state.

4. **Stuck "In Progress" Records**: Records marked as "in_progress" might get stuck, preventing new batches from being processed.

### Recommended Solutions

1. **Implement Smarter Batch Processing**:
   ```sql
   -- Find and reset stalled in_progress records (older than 30 minutes)
   UPDATE email_migration 
   SET status = 'pending', error = NULL, error_message = NULL
   WHERE status = 'in_progress' AND updated_at < now() - interval '30 minutes';
   ```

2. **Add Comprehensive Monitoring**:
   - Batch success rate tracking
   - API response time monitoring
   - Rate limit detection and reporting

3. **Enhance Error Recovery**:
   - Add automatic retry with exponential backoff
   - Create granular error categorization
   - Implement self-healing for common error patterns

## Migration Batch Performance
Using our new analytics function, we can now track batch performance metrics to optimize the process:

```sql
-- Example query to analyze batch performance
SELECT * FROM get_migration_batches(5);
```

This shows success rates, processing times, and status distributions by batch, helping identify patterns in failures and optimize future processing.

## Critical API Requirements
- ✅ **BeehiiV API custom fields must be in array format**: `[{"name": "first_name", "value": "John"}]`
- ❌ **Not as object format**: `{"first_name": "John"}` (causes HTTP 400 errors)
